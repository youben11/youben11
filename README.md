# Ayoub Benaissa - youben(11)?

Hi! I'm a final year master student applying homomorphic encryption to deep learning, mainly working on [TenSEAL](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL) and [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) [@OpenMined](https://github.com/OpenMined). When I'm not nerding :nerd_face:, I'm probably working out :martial_arts_uniform: :weight_lifting: :wrestling: :bicyclist: :running_man: or having my cheat meal :pizza: :taco:
